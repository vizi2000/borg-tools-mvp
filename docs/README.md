# Borg-Tools MVP Auto-Documentary System

A comprehensive system for automatically capturing and documenting the development journey of the Borg-Tools MVP project.

## 🎯 Overview

This auto-documentary system creates a living narrative of your development process, automatically capturing:

- **Development Events** - Code changes, features, bug fixes, milestones
- **Project Timeline** - Phase progress, milestone tracking, estimated completion
- **Architecture Decisions** - Decision records with rationale and alternatives
- **Progress Reports** - Automated progress analysis and summaries

## 📁 System Components

### Core Files

- **`DOCUMENTARY.md`** - Main project narrative written in first person
- **`dev-logger.py`** - Captures development events with context
- **`timeline-manager.py`** - Manages project phases and milestones
- **`decision-tracker.py`** - Records architectural decisions (ADR format)
- **`integration-hooks.sh`** - Sets up automated capture via Git hooks

### Generated Files

- **`dev-events.json`** - Raw development event data
- **`timeline.json`** - Project timeline and phase data
- **`decisions.json`** - Decision records database
- **`MILESTONES.md`** - Milestone history and achievements
- **`DECISIONS.md`** - Architecture Decision Records index
- **`progress-report.md`** - Latest progress analysis
- **`adr/`** - Individual ADR markdown files

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Setup Integration Hooks
```bash
./docs/integration-hooks.sh
```

This sets up:
- Git hooks for automatic event capture
- npm scripts for documentary commands
- VS Code tasks for easy access
- Daily summary generation

### 2. Start Logging Your Journey

```bash
# Log development events
npm run doc:log feature "Implemented GitHub OAuth"
npm run doc:log bug_fix "Fixed rate limiting issue"

# Record milestones
npm run doc:milestone "First PDF Generated" "Successfully created first CV PDF" "ai_agents"

# Document decisions
npm run doc:decision "LangGraph Architecture" "Need AI agent orchestration" "Use LangGraph for state management" "Provides reliable multi-agent workflows"
```

### 3. Track Progress

```bash
# Quick progress check
npm run doc:progress

# Full progress report
npm run doc:report

# Daily summary
./docs/daily-summary.sh
```

## 📊 Features

### Automatic Event Capture

Git hooks automatically log:
- **Pre-commit**: Files being staged, change type detection
- **Post-commit**: Commit analysis, milestone detection suggestions
- **Post-merge**: Branch merge events

### Intelligent Classification

Events are automatically classified by:
- **Type**: feature, bug_fix, refactor, test, documentation, etc.
- **Impact**: low, medium, high, critical
- **Story Relevance**: How much it affects the project narrative

### Progress Tracking

Timeline manager tracks:
- **6 Project Phases**: conception → foundation → ai_agents → design_system → testing_optimization → launch
- **Milestone Achievement**: Automatic milestone detection and manual logging
- **Schedule Analysis**: On-track vs. behind schedule assessment
- **Completion Estimates**: Based on phase progress and velocity

### Decision Documentation

Architecture Decision Records (ADR) capture:
- **Context**: What led to this decision?
- **Decision**: What exactly are we choosing?
- **Rationale**: Why is this the best choice?
- **Alternatives**: What other options were considered?
- **Consequences**: Positive and negative outcomes

## 🎨 The Story Format

The main `DOCUMENTARY.md` is written as a first-person narrative, structured as:

- **Chapter 1**: The Vision - Initial idea and motivation
- **Chapter 2**: Architecture Decisions - Key technical choices
- **Chapter 3**: The Foundation - Basic project setup
- **Chapter 4**: Authentication & Data Flow - Core integrations
- **Chapter 5**: The AI Agents - LangGraph implementation
- **Chapter 6**: Design System - UI/UX development
- **Chapter 7**: Performance Optimization - Speed improvements
- **Chapter 8**: Testing & Quality - Comprehensive testing
- **Chapter 9**: Security & Privacy - Security implementation
- **Chapter 10**: The Launch - First successful generation
- **Lessons Learned** - Key insights and takeaways

## 🔧 Integration Options

### VS Code Integration
Run setup to add Command Palette tasks:
- `Documentary: Log Event`
- `Documentary: Add Milestone`
- `Documentary: Show Progress`
- `Documentary: Daily Summary`

### Package.json Scripts
Automatically added scripts:
```json
{
  "doc:log": "python3 docs/dev-logger.py",
  "doc:milestone": "python3 docs/timeline-manager.py milestone",
  "doc:decision": "python3 docs/decision-tracker.py add",
  "doc:progress": "python3 docs/timeline-manager.py progress",
  "doc:report": "python3 docs/timeline-manager.py report"
}
```

### CI/CD Integration
Add to your workflow:
```yaml
- name: Update Documentary
  run: |
    npm run doc:log deployment "Deployed to production"
    npm run doc:report > deployment-summary.md
```

## 📈 Analytics & Insights

The system provides:

- **Progress Analytics**: Phase completion, velocity tracking
- **Decision Impact**: Most referenced decisions, decision patterns
- **Event Patterns**: Development activity heatmaps
- **Timeline Visualization**: ASCII art progress bars and timelines

## 🎯 Best Practices

1. **Log Regularly**: Use git hooks for automatic capture
2. **Mark Milestones**: Record achievements as they happen
3. **Document Decisions**: Capture the "why" behind choices
4. **Review Progress**: Use daily summaries to maintain momentum
5. **Update Narrative**: Manually enhance the story for major developments

## 🔍 Event Types

- `feature` - New functionality
- `bug_fix` - Issue resolution
- `refactor` - Code restructuring
- `test` - Testing improvements
- `documentation` - Docs updates
- `configuration` - Setup changes
- `optimization` - Performance improvements
- `milestone` - Major achievements
- `decision` - Architectural choices

## 📅 Project Phases

1. **Conception** - Planning and architecture design
2. **Foundation** - Basic setup and core integrations
3. **AI Agents** - LangGraph agent development
4. **Design System** - UI/UX implementation
5. **Testing & Optimization** - Quality and performance
6. **Launch** - Final preparations and deployment

## 🎪 Example Usage

```bash
# Start a new feature
git checkout -b feature/oauth-integration
npm run doc:log feature "Starting GitHub OAuth integration"

# Log progress
npm run doc:log feature "OAuth flow working in development"

# Record a decision
npm run doc:decision "OAuth Provider Choice" "Need secure authentication" "Use GitHub OAuth" "Leverages existing developer accounts"

# Mark milestone
npm run doc:milestone "OAuth Complete" "Users can now authenticate with GitHub" "foundation"

# Check progress
npm run doc:progress
# Output: Overall Progress: 45%
#         Current Phase: Foundation
#         Schedule Status: On Track

# Generate report
npm run doc:report > weekly-report.md
```

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

**Python scripts not working?**
- Ensure Python 3 is installed
- Check permissions: `chmod +x docs/*.py`

**Git hooks not triggering?**
- Verify executable: `ls -la .git/hooks/`
- Re-run: `./docs/integration-hooks.sh`

**Missing npm scripts?**
- Re-run setup to update package.json
- Manually add scripts if needed

## 🎉 The Result

This system transforms your development process into a compelling narrative, capturing:

- **The Journey**: From initial frustration to elegant solution
- **The Decisions**: Why each choice was made and alternatives considered
- **The Milestones**: Key achievements and breakthrough moments
- **The Lessons**: Insights gained throughout development

Your future self (and team members) will thank you for this living documentation that goes far beyond traditional commit messages and README files.
